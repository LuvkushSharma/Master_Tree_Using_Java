What is Binary Search Tree?

Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.


Note : Each Node of BST should follow the properties of BST.

Algo :

----> Let's say user has entered a number 'n'

----> if (n > root.val)
        so, put it in the right part

----> if (n < root.val)
        so, put it in the left part
