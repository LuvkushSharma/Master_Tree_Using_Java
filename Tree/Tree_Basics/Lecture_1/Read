Tree is a non-linear data structure.

---------------- Tree Terminologies ---------------------


                              1
                           /     \
                          3       7
                        /   \    /
                       4     9  8

1) Root Node : Top node of the tree or the origination of the tree.

Here 1 is the root node.

2) Children :

3 and 7 are childrens of 1 similarly, 4 and 9 are the childrens of 3.


3) Parent :

3 is the parent of 4 and 9, 1 is the parent of 3 and 7. and 7 is the parent of 8.


4) Siblings :

children having same parent.

Like, 4 and 9 are siblings as they have the same parent i.e 3
Similarly, 3 and 7 are the siblings since both have the same parent i.e 1.


5) Ancestors :

Fix a particular node and goes upward then, the nodes comes during the upward movements  will be the
ancestor of that particular node.

Ex: 3, 1 are the ancestor of 4


6) Descendent :

7 and 8 are descenents of 1. Similarly, 3 and 9 are the descendents of 1

7) Leaf :

Nodes which  does not contains childs.

Ex: 4,9 and 8


Binary Tree : It has at max 2 childs i.e <=2 nodes.

Types of binary trees :

1) Full Binary Tree or Strict Binary Tree : All levels have either 0 or 2 children.

2) Complete Binary Tree : a. All levels are completely filled except the last level.
                          b. The last level has all nodes as left as possible.

3) Perfect Binary Tree : All leaf nodes are at the same level.

4) Balanced Binary Tree : Height of a tree at max can be log(N) where N is the number of nodes.

5) Degenerate Binary Tree : Whenever every node has a single child only.

6) Skewed Tree :

   a) Left skewed : All the childs are on the left side.
   b) Right skewed : All the childs are on the right side.




 To maintain the hierarchy we use tree data structure

 Tree which are important for the interviews.

     1. Binary tree
     2. Binary search tree (BST)
     3. Generic tree

     and trie is one of the generic tree.


                     10
                   /  |  \
                  20  30  40
                /  \      / | \
               50  60    78 44 12
                  /  \
                 -11 65

     Generic tree main kitne bhi child ho sakte hain.

     Childs jinke paas further child nhi hain woh leaf node hongye. EX : 50 , -11 , 65 , 30 , 78 , 44 and 12

     10 is the root node.
